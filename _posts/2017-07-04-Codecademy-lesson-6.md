  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by making sure I read through all the instructions carefully and used it to get through the rest of functions and taking a vacation. I got through quite a lot and I used time at home and school to further my knowledge.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that despite me trying to do my work when the wifi was working it cut out meaning I had to do the work another time. This meant that what I had just done was not fresh in my mind and it took me a while to get going.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I work so that I try to keep everything fresh in my mind and this will also improve my learning and the amount of work I get done as I will always be thinking about it. This means I will remember it more easily.</td>
