  <tr>
    <td>I learned by experimenting and trying new things. We used the book to type in the code, analyse what was wrong, and make it work after a few tries. We worked hard together alternating between jobs to fully understand exactly what we were doing and how to do it. Working together was effective as on this job we were telling the computer about ourselves and the computer was answering. This meant we had to keep track of what happened to make sure everything worked and made us learn more.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that we had to type a lot of text and for me it was hard not to miss tiny details which ruined the program. Because of me missing fine details, it added a lot more time on to simpler tasks as we had to search, identify and change the mistakes I made. I need to work on typing faster, more accurately and recognising finer details so we don't make the time consuming mistakes. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I look at the program the book shows us. I will look at the program line by line not as the whole thing as one big picture. This will improve my learning by making me get the program right down to the finest detail so that we can progress quickly and correctly. </td>
