  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying out lots of ways to complete a lesson and also reading and taking in the instructions that the lesson gave me. Guessing was the most effective way to get through as quickly as possible and learning why I was right afterwards was the easiest way to do it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I was limited by the fact I had only been seeing this code for the first time and the fact that I didn't learn some of the basics at the start really affected how effectively I could move through the harder lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change the fact that I donâ€™t know the basics by running over it again at home. This will also help me improve my learning in the long run as I will be able to do more if I know the basics.</td>
