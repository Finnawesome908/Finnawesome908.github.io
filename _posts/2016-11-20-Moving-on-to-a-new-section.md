(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I think I have reached my target as we got quite far through the book and did as much work as we could.</td>

    <td>In our lesson we started on the numbers topic. I found it very interesting as we were learning how to draw using pixels.. So far we have made a space invader by copying the numbers of the book and putting the pixels on. We also used a command which made the picture appear bigger or smaller. The best way to do all this was probably to use the book until you know enough of the basics to experiment. (e.g. with different sizes and colours)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was probably the amount of numbers that had to be in the right order. It made it very easy to make a mistake and therefore when we were typing the numbers we had to slow down. It did make our target harder but I think we reached our goal as we got through as much as we could even if we were quicker at typing the numbers.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure we try to type the numbers in quicker to maximise the amount of work we do every lesson as then we will learn a more and improve the way we code with numbers in general.</td>
