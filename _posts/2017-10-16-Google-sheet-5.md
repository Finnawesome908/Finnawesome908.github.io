    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to the teacher and using the my rational thinking of what a business would need to pay and how it would get its money to help make sure I don't miss anything and get the proper sheet I need.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my learning was limited by the fact I had missed some of the lessons and so even though I caught up, I didnâ€™t fully understand everything and so was often behind in my learning</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my working so I can do as much in the lesson as possible and try to do a lot in as little time as possible so I could finish it quicker and not have to do as much at home. Also I will change the way I think so I will think like a computer.
