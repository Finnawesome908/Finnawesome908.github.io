    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to the teacher and thinking what code I could use in specific circumstances. I also learnt by asking my classmates for the stuff I missed so I could catch up and not be behind when I am in the class to come.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my learning was limited by the fact I had a music lesson and had to learn some of it second hand and not always in the detail I might of needed however I need to work on planning ahead so I can get someone to show me straight after instead of rushing around at a lunchtime.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my working so I can do as much in the lesson as possible and try to forge onwards not just do some work then get confused and ask for help. I will improve more if I try to do as much as possible by myself and keep going to find new ways to solve the problems I am facing.</td>
