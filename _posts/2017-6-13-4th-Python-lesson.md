    <td>To work through Python</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using what the exercise told me to do and I tried to use the knowledge I had gained from previous exercises and applied it to the exercises I was doing at that point.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that some of the exercises, I got stuck on and it slowed me down so that I didn't get through that much of the Python overall. I need to work on remembering skills so I can move through exercises as quick as possible and still learn.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will take in all the information better so that I am slower in the learning and faster in the roundup of the Unit in Python. I can improve by trying to learn the concepts more thoroughly.
