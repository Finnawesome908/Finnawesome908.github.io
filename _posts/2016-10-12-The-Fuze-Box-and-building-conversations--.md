    <td>I learnt by trying new strategies and approaching the problems from different angles to complete the problem. The strategies that were successful were using the book to guide what you do but not copying otherwise you will have to "learn" it again in the next lesson. To properly move forward you need to do what the book tells you and then experiment. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had to keep looking back because I had forgot what I had done the week before and only copied, not learnt what was in the book. This meant our progress was slow and we made some mistakes which took time and concentration to correct. We even made a mistake which we couldn't find and had to do the work all over again. I need to work on not copying and learning more.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will experiment without copying the book with different variables and text to see if I really understand what is in the book. If I learn it and experiment more, I will improve my learning by being quicker, more efficient and actually learn it to use in the future. Especially when we do even harder coding, I need to be able to do the basics easy peasy and not just do it while reading or copying it off a book</td>
