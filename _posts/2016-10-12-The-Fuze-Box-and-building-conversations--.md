    <td>The lesson was not really a lesson in which I was learning. It was more about testing the skills I have already learnt and using them to create the project. The strategies that were effective were copying and then reflecting on what we had just done so that we know why we did it. Another strategy that was effective was trial and error. Try something and see where there was an error and then look at the book to understand where you went wrong. It tested how much we knew much more than if we just copied it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was my typing speed. It stopped us progressing quickly especially when it is a lot of typing and not a lot of reading/learning. Therefore I need to work on the speed of my typing as it came apparent that my typing wasn't good enough to progress as quickly as possible. I also need to work on packing up quicker as we are having to finish early to pack up on time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will pack up quickly, efficiently and as soon as I am told to. I will also try to use trial and error method more when doing the project. I will improve by making my touch typing better and quicker. This will all improve my learning by making us work quicker, more efficiently and for a longer amount of time. This will let us get a lot more into each lesson.</td>
