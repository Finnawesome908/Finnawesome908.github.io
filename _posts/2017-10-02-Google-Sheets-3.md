  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying out different functions and using my logic to help solve obstacles that may have been in my way. I found that thinking hard about how the computer would run it helped solve my problems. The strategy was dumbing it down to how the computer would read it. For example in order to find minus something you have to say 0 - a not just -a because -a is nothing to the computer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that I often didn't think hard enough about how the computer thinks and it took a lot more time than I thought to work my way through it all. I need to work on thinking like the computer more quickly so it takes less time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I think so I can get on quicker and progress further through. I also need to improve my ability to catch up as I missed the lesson and it took me a very long time to catch up on all the work that I missed.</td>
