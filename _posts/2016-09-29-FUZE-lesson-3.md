  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by carefully reading the book and taking everything that was in the book and using it in my code until I was successful. I used the book to learn and in doing so learnt quickly and efficiently. I also used a trial and error approach, if something didn't work I would try it slightly differently and see if that worked, and try it again etc. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that we had forgot what we had done the week before therefore, I need to work on remembering everything we do and maybe even trying it at home. This will solidify my knowledge and make myself better, more confident and a more competent coder.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will remember what I did in the lesson before by trying to think about what to do next and think about the coding out of the lesson as well as in the lesson to make me better. I will continue to work as quickly as possible.</td>
