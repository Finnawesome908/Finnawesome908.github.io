**FUZE blog post - Programming 20/9/16**

Our target was to continue working through the book we had been given at a fast pace and we met that target.

**How Did I Learn**

I learnt about the basic coding and how to use the raspberry pi, the coding operating place, the input the output and how to use variable colour and basic code to run a basic program. Working together with one person reading and another person coding (then switching around) worked really well and helped us work as fast and as fairly/equal as possible.

**What limited my Learning**

When we first started we could not find the right cables and so we were behind everyone at the start of the lesson. We need to work on starting quicker so that we can benefit our learning as much as possible. We also need to catch up to the rest of the class as we could not do anything in the first lesson (due to a faulty cable) and had a slow start this week.

**What I Will Change**

We will set up quicker, work even quicker without distraction and get as far as possible. Once we catch up we can slow down and take everything more and that will improve our learning even more.
