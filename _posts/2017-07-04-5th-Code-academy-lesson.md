  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using the instructions and trying lots of different methods to get better at Python. I got very far and am managing to pick up a lot of good skills as I managed to do a whole section and a half in the lesson and at home.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I had some dodgy wifi in our house so I couldn't do as much as the wifi kept cutting out making me lose the rhythm of work and also made it more time consuming meaning I could do less in half an hour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how I work so that I can avoid the time when our wifi is failing so that I can get more done and I will improve my work rate so I donâ€™t get distracted and lose time I can use working on Python</td>
