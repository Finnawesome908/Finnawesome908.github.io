  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying out different ways to complete the task and by reading and taking in the instructions that the lesson gave me. I found that guessing and applying the knowledge I accumulated was the most effective way to get through as quickly as possible. Especially when I got to the harder stages where I had to write more and more code from lessons before. I also felt that If I was stuck, asking a peer for help was very effective and helped me learn quicker and more thoroughly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I was limited by the fact I had never seen any of the code before and therefore took more time to learn the basics. I need to work on not rushing through some of the easier exercises and take every bit of information in because I will need it in the future. I think that will also limit my learning when it gets much harder than it is now. I also need to work on not just giving people around me answers and instead help them learn it themselves. Otherwise they might not actually learn and just go through the exercises.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change the way I work to take more in instead of rushing through everything so that I will learn more in the long run. I will improve my learning by taking in all of the instructions and smaller details and not skim through enough to get to the next exercise. This will also improve my learning in the long run as all these little bits of information will make me a much better coder in the end.</td>
