  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking at Python and reading the instructions so that got as far through the lesson  as possible. These are all the badges from the first and second lesson that  did as I did not put the badges in the first post.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I found some of the instructions difficult and took more time to work through than I thought. This meant that I made slower progress than last week.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to be as fast as possible but also learn it so that I can learn as much of Python as possible. I will improve by being more efficient with my time and maybe doing some work at home.</td>
