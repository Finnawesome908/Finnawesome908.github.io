    <td>To do a stock sheet</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I think I have reached my target as I now have finished the stock sheet for homework.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to my teacher and remembering the functions and equations and then writing them down in my spreadsheet and making myself remember it by continuing to repeat over and over again. I thought that testing some functions out gave me a wider knowledge of google sheets</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I couldn't remember where to put the commas and the small punctuations so it would work and not come up as error because I missed a lot of the hyphens and signs (multiply, add, subtract and divide).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how I look at what Mr Keen is doing so that I really understand every part and concentrate really hard on remembering exactly what I have to do so I remember the punctuation.</td>
  </tr>
