    <td>I learnt by listening and thinking about the things mr Keen told us for example: being independant and trying to work everything out by ourselves instead of only when we were being told to. He used an analogy which was about McDonald's. He asked for 15 McNuggets and the person at the till said "We only serve 6, 9 and 20s". They were so robotic and reliant on the system to do it for them they couldn't add up 6 and 9 to get 15. This made me work harder to experiment with different things.  </td>

    <td>My careless mistake when I first coded the website made it harder to find a way to change all the colours to what I wanted as I had filled in everything in with blue. I still need to fix that and so that is why I have not yet reached my target yet. I need to work on not being careless with coding as it will come back to bite you when something goes wrong. Mr Keen used another analogy about factory workers and how they just wrap or move or shred stuff for shifts of up to 12 hours. 12 hours!</td>

    <td>Next time I will not be gormless and work out the problems for myself. I need to not be like McDonaldâ€™s and factory workers as they are robotic and only do stuff when they are told. I also need to try not to be careless in coding as it will:
mess up your website, take a long time to fix and, come back to bite you in the future when you have to work on the website another time.</td>
