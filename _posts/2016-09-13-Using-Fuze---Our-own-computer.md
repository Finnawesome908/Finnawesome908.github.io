**Using Fuze - Our own computer**       13/9/16

**Target:**

To start basic coding on the raspberry within Fuze

I did not achieve my goal this week

**How did I learn?** 

Nothing was effective as nothing I tried worked however I learned that you have to continue learning and taking in ideas even when everything is not working

**What limited my learning?**

Our monitor was not showing what was on the computer and therefore I could not work on coding. I do not know what to work on as I set up the computer and monitor correctly and it didn't work so I cannot choose a target for coding.

**What will I change and improve for my next lesson?**

Next time I will change which cable I get(as sir said it could be cable failure) and make sure I set up the computer quickly as I am a week behind at setting the computer up. I will also listen more as I didn't realise quick enough to do anything about the fact that something wasnâ€™t working.
